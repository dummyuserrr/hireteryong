<h4>NOTES</h4>
<ul>
	<li>I just built a social media with simple functions. This site is boring because its main purpose is TO DEMONSTRATE my web development skills especially on back-end.</li>
	<li>The icon <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-check checks"></span> means that the feature is done. </li>
	<li>The icon <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-unchecked nochecks"></span> means that I'm still working on that feature. </li>
	<li>When creating an account, I recommend you to <b>NOT</b> use your real name</li>
	<li>This website is open-source. You can view its entire source code from my GitHub Repository (<a href="https://github.com/dummyuserrr/hireteryong">https://github.com/dummyuserrr/hireteryong</a>). Yeah, you can copy my codes. I made them as readable as I can.</li>
	<li>To other developers who are much better, feel free to fork it and make a pull request.</li>
	<li>For feedbacks, suggestions, and violent reactions, email me at <b>dthrcrpz@gmail.com</b></li>
</ul>
<h4>Here are the ordinary functions of this demo</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-check checks"></span> USER AUTHENTICATION</b> - You can use your email or username to login. If you're logged in, the word <strong>STRANGER</strong> on this panel heading will be replaced by your name. The <b>LOGIN</b> buttons will also be replaced by <b>LOGOUT</b>.</li>
	<li>
		<b><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-check checks"></span> REGISTRATION</b> - Well, it's obvious. You should also activate your account by clicking the link attached on the email. After that, your account status shown at the top-right side of this panel will be set to <b>VERIFIED</b>. But it doesn't matter. </li>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-check checks"></span> EMAIL/EMAIL VERIFICATION</b> - After registration, an email will be sent to the email you provided. Just make sure that it's correct.
	</li>

	</li>
